My name is **Sumit Mondal**.

I am a digital signal processing fanatic.

I received my Bachelor's & Master's degrees in ECE from [Georgia Tech](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/).

My research team, [Intelligent Digital Communications](https://www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/intelligent-digital-communications), is at the forefront of building cognitive radio networks.

In my freetime, I enjoy skateboarding, hiking, and listening to music. I am an avid traveler and love experiencing new cultures, especially through food!

If you are at all interested in what I am working on, please feel free to email me [__here__](mailto:sumitmondal@gatech.edu).
