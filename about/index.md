My name is **Sumit Mondal**.

I am an ECE graduate student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/).

I am a digital signal processing fanatic.

My research group, [Intelligent Digital Communications](http://www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/intelligent-digital-communications), is at the forefront of building cognitive radio networks. We develop algorithms for wireless devices to dynamically assess their RF data channel.

In my freetime, I enjoy skateboarding, hiking, and listening to music. I am an avid traveler and love experiencing new cultures, especially through food!

If you are at all interested in what I am working on please feel free to email me [__here__](mailto:sumitmondal@gatech.edu).
