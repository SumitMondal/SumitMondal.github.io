      <p><img src="/images/dolphin_v4.jpg" style="width: 35%;display: block; float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 1em;"   alt="cover" /></p>
      <p> My team was motivated by marine researchers who use audio data to monitor the behavior of specific marine mammals. Underwater microphones are able to capture vast amounts of data that would be expensive and time-consuming for a human to manually analyze. The goal of this project is to implement a machine learning algorithm to recognize a specific marine mammal based on audio cues.</p>
      <p>A common frequency transform for audio classification is the Mel Scale, which emphasizes the human hearing frequency ranges. I developed a transformation that emphasizes the frequencies that these marine mammals whistle at, which is around 5-40kHz. This transformation was inspired by the logistic function, thus I named it the Logistic Mel Scale. Checkout the <a href="/docs/ml_poster.pdf">project poster</a> for our results !</p>

      <p><img src="/images/sobel.png" style="width: 35%;display: block; float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 1em;"   alt="cover" /></p>
      <p>Image processing, especially at higher resolutions, can be computationally intensive. An FPGA implementation of an image processing algorithm can greatly expedite runtime. I decided to implement the Sobel operator, a 3x3 convolutional filter, on the Basys 3 FPGA board using VHDL. The Sobel filter is particularly interesting because it highlights the edges of an image, as seen to the left. 
      <p>The input images were 640x480, and were first stored into the FPGA Block RAM, then sent through a 9-value buffer,and then the Sobel operator was performed. Finally, the output image was stored into the remaining FPGA Block RAM, and outputted to a 640x480 monitor via a VGA controller.</p>

      <p><img src="/images/antenna_v3.png" style="width: 40%;display: block; float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0;"   alt="cover" /></p>
      <p>The goal of this project was to design, simulate, and fabricate a directional, high gain, lightweight antenna in the 5.8 GHz band. Furthermore, the purpose of the antenna was to feed an RF energy harvesting circuit, in order to power a small motor, to move a model car. How cool is that ?! </p>
      <p> The Antenna was designed and simulated in Ansys High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS). Our team decided on a patch antenna due to its ease of being fabricated at the <a href="https://hive.ece.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech Hive</a>. I was also integral to the S11 measurement and the slight adjustments needed to make the antenna have a resonant frequency at exactly 5.8 GHz. I used a spectrum analyzer, a stepper motor, and an RF signal generator to gather both the E-plane and H-plane measurements.</p>

      <p>For my embedded systems final design project, a team of my peers and myself created a smart mirror. A smart mirror is a screen with a 1 way mirror overlayed, such that the screen can be used as a mirror with a display for various accessorized information. The information was displayed and controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3.</p>
      <p>Some of the features that our smart mirror implements includes: weather, date, google calendar, google assistant, and google maps traffic. Look good feel good !</p>
