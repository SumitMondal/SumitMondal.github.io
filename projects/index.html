      <p>Image processing, especially at higher resolutions, can be computationally intensive. An FPGA implementation of an image processing algorithm can greatly expedite runtime. I decided to implement the Sobel operator, a 3x3 convolutional filter, on the Basys 3 FPGA board. The Sobel filter is particularly interesting because it highlights the edges of an image, as seen to the left. The input images were 640x480, and were first stored into the FPGA Block RAM, then sent through a 9-value buffer,and then the Sobel operator was performed. Finally, the output image was stored into the remaining FPGA Block RAM, and outputted to a 640x480 monitor via a VGA controller.
