      <p>For my Senior Design Capstone project, a team of engineers and I designed a Robotic Blimp Guide. The idea was to create a robotic guide to navigate users through a large unknown environment such as a museum, stadium, or convention center.</p>
      <p> Why choose a blimp you might ask? Quadcopters are dangerous in populated environments and a wheeled robot is unable to climb stairs or avoid people as easily as a floating blimp ! </p>
      <p> The robotic blimp has an onboard camera that our team used to implement a computer vision algorithm to recognize <a href="https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag">April Tags</a>. The robotic blimp uses the april tags to traverse the environment. I was the lead designer of the proportial-integral-derivative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">(PID) controller</a>, which is the main code that drives the robots motors towards the user-defined location.</p>
