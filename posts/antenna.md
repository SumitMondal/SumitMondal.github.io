      <p>The goal of this project was to design, simulate, and fabricate a directional, high gain, lightweight antenna in the 5.8 GHz band. Furthermore, the purpose of the antenna was to feed an RF energy harvesting circuit, in order to power a small motor, to move a model car. How cool is that ?! </p>
      <p> The Antenna was designed and simulated in Ansys High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS). Our team decided on a patch antenna due to its ease of being fabricated at the <a href="https://hive.ece.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech Hive</a>. I was also integral to the S11 measurement and the slight adjustments needed to make the antenna have a resonant frequency at exactly 5.8 GHz. I used a spectrum analyzer, a stepper motor, and an RF signal generator to gather both the E-plane and H-plane measurements.</p>
