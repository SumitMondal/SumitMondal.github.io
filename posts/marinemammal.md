      <p> My team was motivated by marine researchers who use audio data to monitor the behavior of specific marine mammals. Underwater microphones are able to capture vast amounts of data that would be expensive and time-consuming for a human to manually analyze. The goal of this project is to implement a machine learning algorithm to recognize a specific marine mammal based on audio cues.</p>
      <p>A common frequency transform for audio classification is the Mel Scale which emphasizes the human hearing frequency ranges. I developed a transformation that emphasizes the frequencies that these marine mammals whistle at, which is around 5-40kHz. This transformation was inspired by the logistic function, thus I named it the Logistic Mel Scale.</p>
