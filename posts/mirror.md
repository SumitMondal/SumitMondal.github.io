      <p>For my embedded systems final design project, a team of my peers and myself created a smart mirror. A smart mirror is a screen with a 1 way mirror overlayed, such that the screen can be used as a mirror with a background display for various accessorized information. The information was displayed and controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3.</p>
      <p>Some of the features that our smart mirror implements includes: weather, date, google calendar, google assistant, and google maps traffic. Look good feel good !</p>
